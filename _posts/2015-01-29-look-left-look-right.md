On the subject of fulfilling long-established life dreams, I have learned two things:

First, expectation is a tricky thing – particularly when you’ve wanderlusted after a place for the better part of your life. My borderline-obnoxious enthusiasm for this city knows no bounds, really.

A union jack has hung in my bedroom for years, I’ve embarrassed many a friend with my British accent practice, and have correctly answered at least 90 percent of Jeopardy questions pertaining to the United Kingdom (or so I estimate). Every English period documentary on Netflix has been extensively watched and if you’re so inclined, you could have me recite you the monarchical lineage back to William I.

Put simply, this experience has been a long time coming. But with that – the mounting anticipation, the building up, the unfiltered excitement – is also the terrifying what if of a fall short of expectation.

No one ever likes to entertain that something isn’t going to be what you want it to be. Having high expectations dashed is infinitely more painful than not having expected anything in the first place.

I’ll admit it: the weather leaves much to be desired, and the accents are not always charming. (Except when someone says cheers, that will always get me.) Everything is expensive and it’s really, really hard to cross the street. Rubbish bins are overwhelmingly difficult to find, and if you’re not quiet on the tube, you’re looked at as if you have a highly contagious disease.

And everyone knows I’m American, even before I open my mouth. I imagine it has something to do with the dazed expression I have while walking through this city.

In any case, all of these things were not what I expected, and yet, London is every bit as magical and impossibly difficult to describe as I hoped it would be.

The second thing I learned: as result of the aforementioned expectation, when you are smack in the middle of the place of your dreams (for lack of a better, less clichéd term), you find it very difficult to believe that you are actually there.

On my first full day in London, I took a district line train to the Westminster station, climbed up the exit stairs and found myself staring up at Big Ben.

But instead of that moment I had expected, the hugely emotional realization of I am actually here, I just kind of stood there stupidly, blocking pedestrian traffic, blinking up into the clock’s face.

It’s important to know that upon arriving in London, most of the texts from my friends asked me, in some form, whether I had cried yet. Whether I was OK. Whether I was functioning well enough to find myself a cab and get to my flat.

(Like I said, really, really happy to be here.)

And there I was, face-to-face with the defining feature of this country – the most picturesque, party-cloudy, quintessentially London day – complete with a few scattered red telephone booths and double-deckers here and there. It was exactly the setting I had been waiting for, and yet…nothing. The tissues I had packed were left very much unused.

I’ve deduced that I’m in shock, and according to WedMD, that can last a while.

It hasn’t quite hit me that I’m really, truly here, but you can expect that when it does, there’ll be a sufficiently dramatic blog post about it. And I’ll make no apology about the newly adopted Britishisms that you’ll find therein.

‘Til then, though, cheers! x
