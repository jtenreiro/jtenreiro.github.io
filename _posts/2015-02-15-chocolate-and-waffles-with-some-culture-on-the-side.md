title: Chocolate and Waffles, with Some Culture on the Side

If you’ve tried to pay cashiers in the wrong currency more than once this week, raise your hand!

Three times to be exact, and it has everything to do with the fact that I’ve got four kinds of currency in my wallet, and have visited more countries in the last few weeks than I had in the last 10 years.

Yes, yes, I acknowledge the fact that I’ve posted once an entire month, but the word whirlwind has never applied to my life until this moment. I’ve actually been doing things interesting enough to warrant blog posts, and my apparent writing neglect aside, I’m really thrilled to share the experience.

Obligatory half-explanation, half-apology aside, here’s what I’ve been up to:

**City:** Brussels, Belgium  
**Companions:** Erika, Jessie, Kayla

Much to my delight, my roommates and I opted to travel to Brussels via the Eurostar. As recently as a few years ago, I developed a deeply seeded fear and hatred for flying, which is both a) inconvenient and b) really embarrassing when it causes me to grab ahold of the stranger next to me at any sign of turbulence.

Setting out to catch our train proved to us our poor sense of time, since we found ourselves running really dramatically through St. Pancras in order to catch the trip that said “FINAL BOARDING” in flashing lights. Eventually, we got there, I breathed another sigh of relief that, unlike planes, Eurostar is planted firmly on the ground, and we set off.

After meeting (and promptly obsessing over) our host Helena, we set off into the center of the city at around 11 o’clock with the naïve idea to find some kind of food. The resulting journey was a foray into a) a half-rave bar where we were greeted by a 90-year-old woman in a rocking chair, b) a restaurant-bar where every patron was speaking sign language and c) a charming, authentic African restaurant where we couldn’t even begin to decipher the language in which the menu was in and then, finally, mercifully d) a frites place that didn’t judge us too greatly when we were ultra-American and called them “French fries.”

If you didn’t know that frites were a thing in Belgium, don’t fret. We didn’t either. But they were, and it was as impossibly delicious as it sounds.

After our bellies were full with frites and the weird combo of sauces our hazy, food-deprived brains told us to get, we headed back home. Our apartment – booked through Airbnb, which is the absolute greatest thing for poor, student travelers – was sleek and minimalist, with lots free space and even more free Wifi, so we tucked into bed extremely content.

Until we realized what it meant when Helena had said in her really charming broken English, “I don’t like to sleep in the heat.” But it wasn’t anything that three more layers and an extra pair of socks couldn’t fix.

The next morning found us doing a lot of wandering, which might frustrate the seasoned traveler, but was perfect for our little group. I find that I prefer the “Lost in [insert city here]” approach, because it’s your reaction is a lot more authentic when you come across something grand by chance. We had our prioritized places, but between the palaces and shops, we took our time getting to know Brussels.

Most of our time was spent in the central area around Grand Place, a massive square surrounded by soaring turrets of museums and the Town Hall. We hit chocolate shops galore, including one where you could indulge in a self-made hot chocolate: hot, frothed milk that you stir a generous hunk of flavored chocolate into. Erika (our resident chocoholic) was talented at finding the shops with free samples, so we worked out way through them until lunchtime.

At one point, we accidentally ran into one of the better known gems of Brussels: Manneken Pis, of for those of you who haven’t perfect your Flemmish yet, the Peeing Boy. For some reason unbeknownst to us, someone had dressed him in some pretty ridiculous looking clothing, which only served to make me laugh more inappropriately at this pretty culturally relevant site.

Later that night, we went a bit seafood crazy (also one of Belgium’s “things,” who knew?), got mussels in Brussels and thoroughly enjoyed the rhyme, and our food. We followed it up with an adventure at Delirium Café, a famous bar that holds the Guinness World Record for most beers – over 3000! Erika (also our beer connoisseur) was pretty jazzed.

The night ended with some pretty embarrassing accent attempts, making someone’s day by giving them an American dollar, and witnessing an Aladdin duet between a very inebriated Belgian man and a character who insisted he was going to be Europe’s next great pop star.

The next day was a bit of sightseeing – the Grand Palace, the Marguerite museum, the Waffle Factory (where I fell deeply in love with my Nutella and strawberries-topped masterpiece) and numerous frites places – before we hopped back onto Eurostar and headed back toward London.

It was a strange but incredibly welcome feeling, returning to London and feeling the satisfaction of heading home after an adventure.

If you’re wondering whether or not I’ve had that dramatic moment of self-realization, I won’t lie: no. Everything is still frustratingly surreal, the fact that I’m spontaneously jetting around the world included.

Traipsing around Europe is the kind of thing that protagonists in coming-of-age, existentialist films do. The ones that have beautiful actors who can just barely get away with playing minors at the age of 30.

And apparently, me. For a little while at least.

Cheers! x
