To quote myself (my Tweet, actually, so even more shame-worthy): Back in a newsroom and everything is right in the world.

While, yes, I have an absolute plethora of stories to share from the countries I’ve been frolicking around for the past few weeks, no adventure has been quite like my first week at the office. Eye rolls welcome, I can freely admit I’m dorkily enthusiastic about all things journalism, but that’s how you’re supposed to feel about your career path, isn’t it?

Plus, I’m working at a political news magazine whose parent company is one of the foremost sources for parliamentary news, which makes interning in London that much more thrilling.

In any case, I woke up miraculously early (for me) on Tuesday morning, hauled myself out of bed and skipped my way over to the tube. I won’t lie and pretend like I wasn’t giddy with the idea of donning my “smart-casual” work clothes and heading off to a job, because I was.

There was some teasing courtesy of my hall-mates, though I probably deserved it, because wearing a blazer shouldn’t make anyone that happy.

But I couldn’t help but feel (overly)enthusiastic about this little taste of real worldliness. I’m at the young-adult-limbo part of life, where parting with my collegiate youth is mildly terrifying but the prospect of being a grown-up, functioning member of the real world is wholly exciting.

Regardless, I showed up about 15 minutes early (I’m a tad dilatory by nature, so this was a fantastic step in the right direction), and did an excellent job keeping composure as my boss guided me through the newsroom and to my desk.

I was gifted a very fancy looking recorder, introduced to the even fancier looking coffee machine and made a very happy camper when I noticed my seat gives me an excellent view of the television, which streams BBC broadcasts throughout the day.

Did I mention I’m less than a 10 minute walk away from Buckingham Palace? Uh, hi, excuse me, but who gets to take their lunch break at Buckingham Palace?!? Okay, yes, QEII, but that was a given.

As of now, I have two bylines online and am slotted for a co-byline in March’s print issue of the magazine, which I’m thoroughly proud of, especially given the fact that the mag focuses on the civil service, which is an area of politics that is incredibly unfamiliar to me. I poured over my research before I came, but every day there’s something I learn about public and private sectors, the ongoing debate on technology and the incredible work that some of these servants are accomplishing.

Also, they took me to lunch and promised me a crash-course on British candy, so there’s that. It was my first Nando’s and I’m flummoxed as to how I survived nearly 21 years without Peri Peri sauce.

Now, I loved the first half of the semester, I really did. I took two classes on journalism, with one being about the role of a foreign correspondent and what covering war and conflict is like. It was incredibly interesting and the professor formerly worked for the BBC (namely, my desired place of employment), so I sat eagerly up front and got to play around at Broadcasting House.

But there’s something about getting back into a newsroom, back into the flow of writing-editing-transcribing-editing again-etc. that I’ve been craving to get back to.

I miss my campus paper (Lehigh University’s The Brown and White) an almost overwhelming amount – and the staff is putting together some awesome stuff, which makes me pine after Wednesdays and Sundays in Coppee even more than I already did.

Getting rid of my “lead news editor” title on my Twitter bio was an emotional four seconds, I kid you not.

But, with this internship, I’m back to helping put something great together. I get to lend a hand in the production of something bigger than anything one thing I could accomplishment on my own, and that’s the best thing I could’ve asked for.

Plus, they’ll let me run around parliament sometimes.

Which brings me back to the beginning: …and everything is right in the world.

Hopefully soon, I’ll be headed off to the House of Commons to watch a rousing sessions of Prime Minister’s Questions. I’ll be sure to let you know when David Cameron and I have been formally introduced.

Until next time, though, cheers! x
