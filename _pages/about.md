For as long as I can remember, I have loved telling stories.

It started with filling dozens of notebooks with them — recounting the details to anyone who would listen. I loved to share things with people. Even more so, I loved making people care about something.

Years later, I see journalism as the telling of the most important stories — and I have a passion for being at the core of that process. As an aspiring TV news producer, I want to bring together many moving parts into a cohesive final product.

I graduated from the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University with an M.S. Broadcast and Digital Journalism, and Lehigh University with a B.A. Journalism.

When I’m not in the newsroom, you can find me with my nose in a book or planning my next culinary adventure. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me!
