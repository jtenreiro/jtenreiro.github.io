Since I was a child, I have loved to tell stories.

I filled dozens of notebooks with them — recounting the details to anyone who would listen. I loved to share things with people. Even more so, I loved making people care about something.

Years later, and I now see journalism as the telling of the most important stories. It’s taking a myriad of elements and combining them to effectively and accurately tell people about what matters.

As an aspiring TV news producer, I hope to be at the heart of that process. I am a curious and determined person, and my newsroom experience has instilled in me a passion for creating a strong final product out of many moving parts.

I have a strong interest in politics and current events, and I hope my passion for these topics intersects with my professional career.
